# My Blog, managed with Obsidian and Quartz

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/12a37b42-86e2-4eef-bdeb-df1ccbc42d2b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ungraphophobic/deploys)

Interested in trying out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)? It's a great tool, and I doubt you will regret it. On the other hand... there are a *lot* of customization options that can lead to hours of procrastinating with the excuse of "productivity." ðŸ˜…

Already use Obsidian and interested in hosting your notes online for FREE? Check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)! There's some customization, but not that much. Oh, and it doesn't support Dataview, so if you use that in your notes you should wrap the codeblocks in comments so they don't render on the site (they will render just fine in Obsidian though ðŸ˜‰).
