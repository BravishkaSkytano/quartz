### Part One: Introduction to Philosophy

#### 1. What Is Philosophy?

> [!PDF|note] [[Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler.pdf#page=9&selection=27,31,30,30&color=note|Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler, p.9]]
> > a course in philosophy is not an attempt to teach some unusual set of facts or to provide a totally new skill. It is, rather, an effort to help the student improve an ability that he already possesses and at times exercises on his own.
> 
> I’ve definitely done some philosophizing before

> [!PDF|note] [[Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler.pdf#page=10&selection=42,42,51,5&color=note|Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler, p.10]]
> > Briefly, however, the indispensable ingredient possessed by a good philosopher is an inquiring or questioning mind.
> 
> So, I just have to be curious like a child? And do I need to answer these questions?

> > the word philosophy comes from two Greek words which mean “loving wisdom.”

> > In this view of philosophy, the primary role of philosophy was ethical education. That is, philosophy was to teach the good life.
> 
> The ancients, like the Greeks, were primarily concerned with finding happiness through knowledge and wisdom.

> [!PDF|yellow] [[Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler.pdf#page=12&selection=8,59,25,17&color=yellow|Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler, p.12]]
> > Simply put, it is the disagreement among philosophers whether philosophy is solely concerned with the analysis of concepts and presuppositions, or whether it is something more
> 
> That alone tells me how complicated philosophy is! It sounds like a broad subject meant to encourage thinking about nearly everything with universal and moral importance.

> > Philosophical inquiry began in a systematic way in the Greek colony of Miletus, roughly about 600 B.C.

> > Conceptual analysis is the belief that the sole or at least a central concern of philosophy is the analytic study of concepts.
> 
> A analyst, but not a scientist; philosophers clarify the “why” behind concepts, principles, and actions, while scientist find the “what” and the “how”.

> [!PDF|yellow] [[Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler.pdf#page=13&selection=29,0,32,32&color=yellow|Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler, p.13]]
> > Analytic philosophy has exerted considerable influence on the development of contemporary thought through the writings of its leading adherents, George Edward Moore (1873–1958), Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951).
> 
> But it wasn’t until the twentieth century that analytic philosophy was popular enough to be recognized as a school of philosophy.

> > Some feel that analytic philosophy overemphasizes questions of meaning and underemphasizes questions of truth.

> [!PDF|note] [[Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler.pdf#page=13&selection=42,0,44,7&color=note|Introduction to Philosophy A Christian Perspective by Norman Geisler, p.13]]
> > According to the verification principle, a statement is meaningful only if it is either purely definitional or else verifiable by one or more of the five senses.
> 
> This means that every other proposition would be meaningless even though it was established as a fact.

> > We can spend so much time defining the terms in a statement that we lose sight of the truth of the statement.
> 
> So true!

> > While analytical philosophy is interested in analyzing the foundations of knowledge, speculative philosophy, at least in its more extreme forms, is concerned with synthesizing the results of the conceptual inquiry into a comprehensive and integrated view of reality.
> 
> Analytical philosophy = “why” is it like that?
> Speculative philosophy = “how” it should be.
