> > a course in philosophy is not an attempt to teach some unusual set of facts or to provide a totally new skill. It is, rather, an effort to help the student improve an ability that he already possesses and at times exercises on his own.
> 
> I’ve definitely done some philosophizing before

> > Briefly, however, the indispensable ingredient possessed by a good philosopher is an inquiring or questioning mind.
> 
> So, I just have to be curious like a child? And do I need to answer these questions?

> > In this view of philosophy, the primary role of philosophy was ethical education. That is, philosophy was to teach the good life.
> 
> The ancients, like the Greeks, were primarily concerned with finding happiness through knowledge and wisdom.

> > Simply put, it is the disagreement among philosophers whether philosophy is solely concerned with the analysis of concepts and presuppositions, or whether it is something more
> 
> That alone tells me how complicated philosophy is! It sounds like a broad subject meant to encourage thinking about nearly everything with universal and moral importance.
