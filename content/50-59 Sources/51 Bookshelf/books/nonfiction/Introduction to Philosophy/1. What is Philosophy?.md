> a course in philosophy is not an attempt to teach some unusual set of facts or to provide a totally new skill. It is, rather, an effort to help the student improve an ability that he already possesses and at times exercises on his own.

- *philo* (love) + *sophy* (wisdom) = *philosophy* (loving wisdom)
- the ancients, like the Greeks, were primarily concerned with finding happiness through knowledge and wisdom.
- philosophers disagree among themselves as to the definition of philosophy
- began around 600 B.C. in Miletus, a Greek colony

## Analytic philosophy or conceptual analysis

- ==main purpose of philosophy is the analytic study of concepts==
- philosophers clarify the “why” behind our beliefs and actions
- popular enough to be recognized as a school of philosophy in the twentieth century
- Objections
	- questions about meaning are glorified while questions about truth are pushed under the table
	- the key concept of the verification principle is unreliable
		- the meaningfulness of propositions are NOT determined by 1+ of the five senses, or it’s definitional state

> We can spend so much time defining the terms in a statement that we lose sight of the truth of the statement.

## Speculative philosophy

- “how” it should be; how we should act
- comes after analytic philosophy; knowledge of the concepts is required before one can determine how they should work
- Objections
	- it’s impossible to combine all knowledge and values
	- it’s nonsense and pointless

> Philosophy is, then, the critical analysis of fundamental concepts of human inquiry, and the normative discussion of how human thought and action ought to function, as well as the description of the nature of reality.
