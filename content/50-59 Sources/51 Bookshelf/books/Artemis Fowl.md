I love the way [[Eoin Colfer]] writes, it’s very engaging. As for Artemus Fowl, there is a bit to like about the character and his ingenuity.

The book seemed a bit fast-paced for me and I didn’t enjoy it as much as I expected to. Perhaps it’s just my current state of mind or the lower reading level, but I enjoyed the way Colfer wrote more than the actual story he penned.
