The three main categories of thought are Aristotelian, neo-Platonic, and mechanistic. The first, and oldest, of the three was named after Aristotle himself and described reality as a composition of many different substances, each with their own unique properties. One who holds to the Aristotelian view would prioritize observation and classification of natural phenomena.

The next perspective is called the neo-Platonic view, and it was inspired by Plato. This view handles concepts like forms, ideas, and the soul by focusing on abstract objects and ideas, which have greater realities than the physical world.

The last, and more modern, view compliments the Scientific Revolution that helped craft it by envisioning the universe as a complex machine with fixed laws and processes. Mechanistic thinkers dwell on quantifiable and physical processes that they believe shape the world we live in.
