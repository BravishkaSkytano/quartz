## INTRODUCTION

What is feminism? It started as equal rights for women and then turned into giving women more rights and protections. As Christians, it’s important that we know what the Bible has to say about a topic before we engage in it and pick sides, yet most female Christians will accept the label of feminist without opening their Bibles. In today’s world, there is an increasing attack on women and their rights, but before we call out for the feminists to wake up, we need to take a moment and consult the Bible first. Once we’ve done that, we need to understand what it means to truly be a feminist and align that with what the Bible calls females to be. Only then can we choose to say, “I am both a Christian and a feminist.”

First off, it’s important to define the term “feminism.” According to the American Heritage Dictionary, feminism is defined as “belief in or advocacy of women’s social, political, and economic rights, especially with regard to equality of the sexes.”[@americanheritagerdictionaryoftheenglishlanguagefifthedition.Feminism] In theory, it sounds like a good thing to stand up for, but what exactly are women’s social, political, and economic rights?

There are three nationally recognized waves of feminism. The first wave occurred from 1848-1920, the second wave was from the 1960s-1970s, the third wave began in the 1990s, and the end between the fifth and the beginning of the fourth is difficult to pinpoint. There’s also the possibility of a fifth wave happening sometime soon.

## FIRST WAVE

The first wave of feminism began in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York when Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized a convention for American woman’s rights.[@pruittWhatAreFour2023] For nearly four decades, women fought to have the same basic rights as their male counterparts, mainly the ability to vote. Even black men could vote before women with the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870, an event that obviously angered quite a few women. It wasn’t until fifty years afterward in 1920 when the Nineteenth Amendment was passed that women, specifically white women, were granted voting rights.

## SECOND WAVE

The concept of the “waves of feminism” wasn’t coined until the late 1960’s, when the feminist movement shifted into something different from the original. It was during this wave that feminism drastically changed from focusing on giving equal rights between men and women to focusing on sex and work. The second wave of feminism wasn’t the only thing that was going on during this time, the Civil Rights Movement also fought for public attention.[@masterclassWavesFeminismWaves] While white women demanded for more equality with white men, black women sought to escape marginalization and get their own rights.

## THIRD WAVE

Moving on to the 1990’s, the third wave of feminism finally addressed the racism and classism that the previous waves ignored. Black women officially joined the movement as powerful voices of intersectionality and inclusivity.[@masterclassWavesFeminismWaves]

## FOURTH WAVE

After the third wave, it gets a bit fuzzy as to when the fourth wave started and if it’s still the current wave of feminism. Feminists are still working to destroy marginalization against black Americans and now there’s confusion of what defines a woman. Part of the LGBT+ movement has also partnered with feminists to fight for trans rights.

## FIFTH WAVE

There has been new talk about the rising “soft girl” era among some of the younger generation. Young women are rediscovering the true meaning of what a woman is and they want to return to the traditional roles of a woman and a wife. They don’t want to be in the workplace doing what the men do, they want to be stay-at-home wives and raise kids. This fifth wave, if it even begins, will call for the traditional roles women had before second-wave feminism took place. But, as the Wilson brothers put it, the government has made it necessary for a dual-income family because you need a certain amount of money just to survive, and changing that is going to be difficult.[@wilsonbrothersReactionBrettCooper2023]

## Conclusion

The feminist movement has had a large impact on society during the course of it’s existence. Most agrees that the first wave was fundamental and a good change for the country, but there are varying opinions on if the second and/or third waves were truly necessary. David Wilson claims that “The whole idea of feminism was to get women into the system to tax them”[@wilsonbrothersReactionBrettCooper2023] and it didn’t help as much as they thought it would.

There are reports that women’s health took a hit during the 70’s because they became victimized and felt wronged by the male population.[CITE] Wilson’s brother Isaac stated it beautifully when he said “if you’re a woman, and you go into a naturally very competitive marketplace that’s dominated by men for so many years, you have to be more masculine in order to compete. So that drive causes you to tap into that masculine energy, [and] there has to be consequences of that over time. It has to wear you down mentally, [and] emotionally.”[@wilsonbrothersReactionBrettCooper2023] Fornication rose, more children were born out of wedlock, and the number of men who abandoned their wives and children became a huge problem. Single-parent families became the new norm when the government started to offer incentives to single mothers based on the amount of children they had. As Michael Knowles said, “women had convinced themselves that they were empowered by sleeping with men.”[@thecommentssectionwithbrettcooperBrettReactsMichael2023]
