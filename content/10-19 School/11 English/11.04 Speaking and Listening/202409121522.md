There are six points to an effective opening: establish a common ground between the speaker and the audience, set the tone for the speech, reinforce or establish the speaker’s credibility, arouse interest in the subject, take as much advantage of “the speaker’s grace period” as possible, and segue smoothly into the topic. Of these six points, President Ronald Reagan used ==four== in his inaugural address on January 20, 1981.

President Reagan began his speech by thanking special officials, and giving a special mention to President Carter for his part in ensuring that the transition process goes smoothly for the nation.

He then goes on to address the nationwide inflation that was the longest one that the United States had suffered up to that point.
