A very simple definition of philosophy might be something like the study of improving one's ability to think about the foundations of thoughts and actions. A better and more complete explanation would be “the critical analysis of fundamental concepts of human inquiry, and the normative discussion of how human thought and action ought to function, as well as the description of the nature of reality” [@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 17]. The word itself comes from Greek and means “loving wisdom.”

In ancient times, philosophy was simply “ethical education,” or teaching the “good life” [@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 13]. Today, the teaching of ethical education has become increasingly unpopular.
