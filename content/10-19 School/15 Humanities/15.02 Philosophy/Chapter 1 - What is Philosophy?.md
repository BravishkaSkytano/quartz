[[20240511170611|Definition of Philosophy]]

Examples of philosophical discussions would be anything pertaining to the “meaning of life” or its “end.” The only tools you need to partake in this study is an analytical, or curious, mind.[@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980]

## The Two Branches of Philosophy

<!-- write about the reason for both and how they work together -->

### Analytic philosophy or conceptual analysis

The first branch of philosophy categorizes the analytic study of concepts as the focus of philosophy; ==the purpose of philosophy is to clarify the language of ideas by defining the philosophic and scientific terms==. ==The philosopher works like a scientist, but instead of systematically explaining the world through observations and experimentation, he examines other scientists, moralists, and theologians to discover the basic presuppositions and concepts that they use.== [@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 14] 

Despite its popularity, not all philosophers prefer analytic philosophy because they believe it focuses too much on finding meaning instead of discovering truth. As Geisler and Feinberg put it, “we can spend so much time defining the terms in a statement that we lose sight of the truth of the statement.” [@geislerIntroductionPhilosophyChristian1980, p. 15]

### Speculative philosophy

Speculative philosophy isn’t very favorable, especially in Anglo-American philosophy, and any argument that its label is immediately ==disdained==. The goal of speculative philosophy is to explain reality and humanities purpose in it, some forms even go so far as declaring how the world and men should act. Eventually, everything gets condensed into a unified view of reality and a single system of religious, moral, and aesthetic values.
