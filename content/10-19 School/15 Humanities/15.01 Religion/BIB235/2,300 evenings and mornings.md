> [[Dan 8#13|Dan 8,13-14]]
> **(13)** Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, "How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?"
> **(14)** He said to me, "To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed."
> [[Dan 8#14|]]

The meaning isn't concrete. In 171 B.C. 2,300 *half days* from the death of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] would be 171 B.C. when Onias III, the legitimate Jewish high priest, was killed. The actual desecration of the temple happened in Dec. 25, 167 B.C. with a new Greek altar. 1,150 *whole days* would point from the the new Greek altar to 1m 15d before the purification of the temple. Both interpretations could fit but insufficient historical data blocks surety.
