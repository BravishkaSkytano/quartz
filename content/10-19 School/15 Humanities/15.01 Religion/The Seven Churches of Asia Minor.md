In [[Revelation 2]][[Revelation 3|-3]], there are seven letters written to seven churches in [[Asia Minor]]—[[Ephesus]], [[Smyrna]], [[Pergamum]], [[Thyatira]], [[Sardis]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Laodicea]]. These churches were located along a popular circular trade route. The letters were written to praise and condemn the recipients for their faithfulness and their shortcomings.

There is still a debate regarding the significance of these letters. There are three views on this, either (1) they only applied to those specific churches, (2) each church symbolized a period in church history, or (3) each church represents a different kind of church in history. The problem with the first viewpoint is that if it were true, then they are no longer prophetic words, and they wouldn’t belong in the book of Revelation. The issue with the second view is that it’s difficult to line up each church with a specific period. Furthermore, this view holds a completely western perspective and doesn’t even include the churches in the Middle East. It is more likely that the third and final viewpoint is correct. Yes, Jesus spoke specifically to those churches, but His Words didn’t just stay there. Jesus’ messages were not meant to just be relevant to the Jews or Gentiles at that time, they are relevant to all Christians in all periods of history. After almost every letter, Jesus tells the reader that whoever has an ear should listen to what the Holy Spirit was speaking and to follow it. The promises mentioned in these chapters were not just for the churches in Asia Minor, they are meant for churches all over the world all throughout history.
