SUMMARY 
FROM 2024-02-26 TO 2024-04-28
```

## Description

What is science? What do scientists do? How is science done? What do scientists think? These questions, and many more, are practically unknown by Christians; but yet, many Christians add their voices to this debate without knowing what the debate is really about. Evolution. Creationism. Creation Science. Fundamentalism. Traditionalism. Naturalism. Darwinism. Faith. Religion. Worldviews. My hope with this course is that you will learn about what science is and how it interacts with the Christian faith.

### Objectives

- Recognize differences in creation theories
- Formulate a personal theology of biblical creationism
