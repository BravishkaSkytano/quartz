> 1. Physical Science: the study of the natural world, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth science.
> 2. Life Science: the study of living organisms, including biology, zoology, botany, and genetics.
> 3. Mathematical Science: the study of mathematical concepts, principles, and methods, including mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
> 4. Health Science: the study of human health and well-being, including medicine, nursing, and public health.
> 5. Engineering Science: the application of scientific principles to design, build, and maintain structures, machines, devices, and systems.
